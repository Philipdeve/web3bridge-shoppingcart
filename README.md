# Shopping Cart Project

This project is a simple shopping cart application built with React and Vite. It allows users to manage shopping cart items, including adding products, increasing/decreasing item quantities, removing items, and calculating the total amount. The cart data is persisted in localStorage, ensuring that items remain in the cart even after the page is refreshed.
